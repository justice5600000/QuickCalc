# QuickCalc
calculator written in c#
-----DESClAIMER-----
This is my first actual project that ive released, so dont expext it to be good
-----HOW TO USE-----
There are 4 functions add,subtract,divide and multiply 
type any one of those in and it should work
this same thing pops up if you type "help"
you dont need to add a number for every promt but just add 0 bc it would crash
